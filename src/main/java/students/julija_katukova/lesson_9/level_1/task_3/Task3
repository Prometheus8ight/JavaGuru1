We cannot make private class.
As soon as we try to use private or protected keyword while declaring an outer class compiler gives a compilation error saying
“Illegal modifier for the class your_class_name; only public, abstract & final are permitted”.
Access modifier "private" makes anything (field, class, method) accessible inside the entity (class or package) in which it is defined.
Defining private access to the class will make it accessible inside the same package which "default" keyword already do for us.
Therefore there is no benefit of defining a class private it will only make things ambiguous.
